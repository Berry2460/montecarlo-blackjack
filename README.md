# Monte Carlo Blackjack Predictor

- A Monte Carlo algorithm for finding win percentages by holding on certain counts

## How it works

The algorithm runs a defined number of Blackjack games per count to hold on, then records the winrate.

*NOTE: Uses the 5 card rule for both the player and dealer.*

## How to use

- Change the `GAMES` definition to any sample size desired.
- Once compiled, execute from the terminal as the program does not pause after computation is complete.
- Enjoy!
